<p>The name <strong>Kluang</strong> derives from the Malay word <em>'keluang'</em> which means a type of flying fox or rather a type of fruit bat, which used to be plentiful in the district decades ago. They have almost completely disappeared due to the combination of hunting and destruction of their natural habitat (deforestation).</p>
<p><strong>Kluang</strong> was founded in 1915 as the administrative capital for central <strong>Johor</strong> by the <em>British</em>.The main railway line linking north to south <em>Malaya</em> was built passing through <strong>Kluang</strong> and this helped in its growth. Roads were built to link <strong>Kluang</strong> to <strong>Johor Bahru</strong> towards the south-east, to <strong>Batu Pahat</strong> towards the south-west and to <strong>Mersing</strong> towards the north-east.</p>
